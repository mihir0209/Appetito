# Appetito - Food Delivery App UI (Jetpack Compose)

Welcome to Appetito, a modern food delivery application UI built entirely with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. This project showcases a complete user flow, from onboarding and authentication to browsing food, placing an order, and managing user profiles. A key feature of this app is its dynamic theming system, allowing users to switch between a clean light mode and a sleek dark mode, with their preference saved across app sessions.

## Key Features

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of building a feature-rich UI in Jetpack Compose.

-   **Dynamic Theming:**
    -   Seamless switching between **Light and Dark themes**.
    -   Theme preference is **persisted** using Jetpack DataStore.
    -   A dedicated toggle in the Settings screen allows users to manually select Light/Dark mode or follow the system setting.

-   **User Authentication Flow:**
    -   **Welcome Screen:** Beautiful onboarding screen with social login options.
    -   **Login & Sign Up:** Clean, user-friendly forms for authentication.
    -   **Verification & Password Reset:** Complete UI for user account management.

-   **Core App Experience:**
    -   **Animated Side Menu:** A custom, animated side navigation drawer with smooth open/close transitions.
    -   **Intuitive Gestures:** Swipe from the screen edge to open the menu, and swipe on the menu or main content to close it.
    -   **Nested Navigation:** A robust navigation graph using two `NavControllers` to manage main app flow and the bottom navigation bar state independently.
    -   **Home Screen:** Features featured restaurants, popular items, and category chips.
    -   **Food Details:** Detailed view of food items with quantity controls and add-on selection.
    -   **Comprehensive Cart Management:** Add, increase, decrease, and remove items from the cart. Includes a clear empty-cart state.

-   **Order & Profile Management:**
    -   **Checkout Process:** A multi-step checkout screen summarizing the order and payment details.
    -   **Order Success Screen:** A confirmation screen with animations after placing an order.
    -   **My Orders:** A tabbed layout (`HorizontalPager`) to view "Upcoming" and "History" orders.
    -   **User Profile:** A detailed screen displaying user information and providing navigation to other sections.
    -   **Restaurant & User Reviews:** Screens for viewing and submitting ratings and reviews.
    -   **Full Suite of Settings:** Screens for managing addresses, payment methods, settings (theme toggle), and help/FAQs.

## ðŸ› Technical Implementation

-   **UI:** Built 100% in **Kotlin** with **Jetpack Compose**, using a single-activity architecture.
-   **Theming:** Implemented a custom `AppetitoTheme` using `MaterialTheme` and `Material 3` components. Colors are defined in `ui/Theme.kt` and dynamically applied.
-   **State Management:** Utilizes `ViewModel` (`ThemeViewModel`) and `mutableStateOf` to manage UI state effectively. The user's theme choice is persisted using **Jetpack DataStore**.
-   **Navigation:** Employs **Jetpack Navigation for Compose** with a nested graph structure for a clean and scalable navigation flow.
-   **Animations & Gestures:** Leverages Compose's animation APIs (`animateFloatAsState`, `AnimatedVisibility`) and the `pointerInput` modifier for custom gesture detection (side menu swipe).
-   **Architecture:** Follows modern Android app architecture principles, with a clear separation between UI (`@Composable` functions) and data (`DemoDataProvider`).
